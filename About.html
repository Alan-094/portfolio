<h1>Hey, I’m Alan!</h1>

<p>I’m a passionate Project Manager who loves working in a team and seeing how we all grow together. My adventure started as a Scrum Master, and although I initially felt like a fish out of water, I managed to get my certification. Who would have thought agility could be so exciting?</p>

<p>Now I’m in a new phase of my life studying web development. I’m trying not to drown in the process (becoming a programmer is quite a challenge!). As I’ve worked with tech teams, this world has increasingly piqued my interest.</p>

<p>I also spent a good amount of time leading a foundation, where I discovered my passion for working with young people and teenagers. I love helping them develop their leadership skills and find their purpose because, let’s be honest, we all need a little direction in this crazy thing we call life.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that passion is key. Besides enjoying what we do, it’s essential to establish habits and clear goals that remind us why we started in the first place. So let’s keep pushing forward!</p>

<p>In summary, for me, life is an interesting adventure where we are called to be the protagonists. I’m here to learn, grow, and above all, have fun while doing it!</p>
